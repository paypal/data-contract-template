## What is a Data Contract?

### The basics of a data contract
A data contract defines the agreement between a data producer and consumer. A data contract contains several sections:
* Fundamentals.
* Schema.
* Data quality.
* Service-level agreement (SLA).
* Security & stakeholders.
* Custom properties.
